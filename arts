That is, until next weekend. Al Pacino (who won the best-actor Oscar for &ldquo;Scent of a Woman&rdquo;) wraps up his four-month run as Shylock on

Strip away the uninspired mythology, and &ldquo;I Am Number Four&rdquo; is just your average high school movie with below-average drama. Fielding familiar classroom stereotypes &mdash; the bully, the science geek, the strutting alien female in the skintight cat suit &mdash; this turgid schedule filler is only marginally more fun than a week&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Putty Hill,&rdquo; Matt Porterfield &rsquo;s moody, elliptical fusion of fiction and documentary, slips back and forth between the forms with a stealth that dissolves one into the other.

Ic&iacute;ar Bolla&iacute;n&rsquo;s bluntly political film &ldquo;Even the Rain&rdquo; makes pertinent, if heavy-handed, comparisons between European imperialism five centuries ago and modern globalization.

Liam Neeson &rsquo;s latter-day renaissance as an unlikely action star should give hope to performers and viewers of a certain age (i.e., over 40) everywhere. While that irrepressible exhibitionist Helen Mirren , born in 1945, continues to inspire legions of AARP members, one discarded garment at a time, Mr. Neeson, a comparative pup born in 1952,

But you run into trouble when you use a familiar plot and do only the familiar with it. &ldquo;Immigration Tango,&rdquo; a pale romantic comedy, has this problem.

One of the most urgent and certainly among the most beautifully shot documentaries to hit the big screen in recent memory, &ldquo;The Last Lions&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just another cute and fuzzy encounter session with a different species. It&rsquo;s a pulse-quickening, tear-duct milking and outrageously dramatized story about the threats &mdash;

The something wicked that comes creeping like night in &ldquo;Vanishing on 7th Street,&rdquo; turning down the sun and seemingly sucking people right out of their homes, offices, cars and clothes, arrives without warning. One minute moviegoers are yukking it up at a multiplex in this generally nifty little horror flick, and the next minute
&ldquo;Loveless&rdquo; is an aimless film about an aimless fellow, but it&rsquo;s not without its charms. It may be without a point, but hey, you can&rsquo;t have everything in a no-budget film like this. Andrew (Andrew Von Urtz) is a nearing-middle-age New Yorker who&rsquo;s still behaving like a self- and sex-centered 25-year-old, trolling for
It&rsquo;s too bad that Paul Levesque is so, well, large.

Poised and whispery, Vanessa Paradis played her New York City debut as a headliner at Town Hall on Wednesday night. In France, Ms. Paradis has been a pop star since she was 14, when her single &ldquo;Joe le Taxi&rdquo; was a No. 1 hit in 1987, and where she won the Victoires de la Musique award, the equivalent of a Grammy , for album of the year

The Tune-In festival at the Park Avenue Armory promises to explore musical connections between past and present, as well as a few philosophical notions, like whether music has the power to express anything.

Meredith Ward Fine Art 44 East 74th Street Manhattan Through March 12 Working in oil on small pieces of canvas board near the waters and harbors of Manhattan, John Marin (1870-1953) was possibly the first American artist to make abstract paintings. There are other candidates &mdash; among them Marsden Hartley and Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe &mdash; but
Rembrandt &rsquo;s jowly, battered face glows like a night light in the great late self-portrait from 1658 at the Frick Collection .

Perhaps because her work so frequently appears in exhibitions, art fairs and auctions, it seems as though Cindy Sherman&rsquo;s photographs are often with us.

The New Museum has become a busy place this year, and it is not yet even March. In January it opened a popular tribute to the market-hardy paintings of George Condo.

The British travel writer and novelist Bruce Chatwin (1940-89) had blond hair, flinty blue eyes and delicately firm features &mdash; he looked like a bookish member of the Police, Sting&rsquo;s band, circa 1983 &mdash; and the kind of narcissism that can be a byproduct of talent mixed with charisma.

BERLIN &mdash; Founded amid the rubble of postwar Germany, once a propaganda showcase for the Allies and an important cultural crossroads between East and West during the cold war, the Berlin International Film Festival has often served as a political lightning rod.

For any savvy operagoer, an evening spent with &ldquo;The Bartered Bride,&rdquo; a rustic comedy by Smetana more widely known about than actually seen, is an evening spent waiting for the other shoe to drop. Introduced in 1866 and completed in 1870, this romantic frolic is built on a plot twist predictable from miles away, a triumph of true love

Haunted songs by the Cowboy Junkies like &ldquo;Lonely Sinking Feeling&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Love Is to Bury&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be turning up on &ldquo;Glee&rdquo; one day, but this band has turned somber into a mysterious sort of success for 25 years.

&ldquo;The Battle for Marjah&rdquo; enters the crowded field of Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield documentaries, where films like &ldquo;Restrepo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gunner Palace&rdquo; and &ldquo;The War Tapes&rdquo; have already made their marks.

Some stars take longer than others to come into telescopic range. Such is the case with Luis Camnitzer, who, in his early 70s and with a half-century career behind him, is just now having his first New York museum survey.
